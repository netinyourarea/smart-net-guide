        <h2>Information we collect</h2>
        <p>
          When you use the Coverage Finder or contact our team we may collect your name, email
          address, phone number, service address or locality, and a description of your
          connectivity needs. We also collect basic technical data such as browser type and pages
          viewed to keep the site working reliably.
        </p>
        <h2>How we use your information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To determine which broadband and cable services are serviceable at your location.</li>
          <li>To prepare, submit and follow up on a connection request you have approved.</li>
          <li>To respond to support questions and provide setup assistance.</li>
          <li>To improve the accuracy of our availability information and site performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          Details are shared with a service provider only where necessary to progress a request you
          have approved. We do not sell personal information. Service partners receive only the
          information required to complete the request.
        </p>
        <h2>Data retention and security</h2>
        <p>
          Information is retained for as long as needed to service your request and meet legal
          obligations, then removed. We use industry-standard safeguards including encrypted
          transmission and restricted internal access.
        </p>
        <h2>Your choices</h2>
        <p>
          You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your information at any time by
          reaching out through the Contact page. You can also opt out of marketing communication
          without affecting an active request.
        </p>
        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          We use essential cookies for site functionality and limited analytics cookies to
          understand which pages are useful. You can disable non-essential cookies in your browser.
